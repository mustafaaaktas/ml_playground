# ML Playground

Welcome to my `ml_playground` repository! Here, I explore various concepts, techniques, and experiments related to machine learning, data science, and AI. This is a personal sandbox where I try out ideas, document my learning process, and share code snippets that I find interesting or fun.

## What You'll Find Here

- **Jupyter Notebooks**: 
  - Experiments with cost functions in linear regression.
  - Visualizations that help deepen understanding of model parameters.
  - Future notebooks covering data preprocessing, model evaluation, neural networks, and more.

## Learning Resources

I'm currently taking a Machine Learning Specialization course, and I’m also reading the book **"Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow"** by Aurélien Géron (O’Reilly Media). These resources guide my learning and inspire the experiments you see in this repository.

## Purpose

The main goal of this repository is to document my learning progress, experiment with different ML techniques, and share any insightful findings. It serves as a personal logbook, showcasing how my approach and understanding evolve over time.

Feel free to explore, learn with me, and adapt any of the code or ideas here for your own projects.
