# ML Playground ✨

Welcome to my **ML Playground**! This repository is where I explore various facets of machine learning, from foundational concepts to more advanced techniques, with an emphasis on practical, hands-on experimentation. By revisiting established approaches and experimenting with diverse datasets, I continuously refine both my theoretical understanding and my coding proficiency.

## Purpose & Goals

- **Deepening Expertise in NLP and ML:**  
  My ultimate aim is to develop a stronger background in **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and machine learning. This includes solidifying theoretical and mathematical foundations, while gaining hands-on experience with a variety of models, tools, and frameworks.

- **Discovery & Skill-Building:**  
  Not every project here is groundbreaking or unique. Instead, I frequently revisit well-known methods and datasets as a form of deliberate practice. This ensures steady improvement in understanding core principles, implementing scalable solutions, and interpreting model behaviors.

## Repository Structure

- **Cost_Function_Visualization/**
  - `cost_function_visualization.ipynb`: Visual demonstrations of cost functions in linear regression, offering intuitive insights into gradient descent and parameter optimization.

- **MultiVariable_Linear_Regression_Life_Expectancy/**
  - `notebook.ipynb`: A lecture-style notebook implementing multivariate linear regression from scratch. Using datasets from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kumarajarshi/life-expectancy-who/data) (and WHO/UN sources), this project showcases feature scaling, gradient descent optimization, and model evaluation metrics.

## Learning Resources & Inspiration

I draw knowledge and inspiration from:
- **[Machine Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/machine-learning-introduction)** on Coursera:  
  Providing structured, university-level coursework in ML fundamentals.
- **[Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow](https://a.co/d/9aHzeX1)** by Aurélien Géron:  
  A practical guide to building modern ML and deep learning systems.
- **[Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/mustafaaaktas) Datasets & Competitions:**  
  A go-to resource for acquiring diverse, real-world datasets that sharpen data wrangling, modeling, and inference skills.
